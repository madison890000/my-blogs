# Coding and Cooking

I finally moved to Auckland and started living with my fiancee (we were separated for a year due to being in different countries).
I have taken up the responsibility of doing the dishes at home again, as I am not very good at cooking. 

Due to being unemployed, I have rare free time of two months without work. 

This period of time has allowed me to pause and reflect on life and work. 
I have discovered something interesting - the similarities between my professional work as a programmer and cooking in daily life.

As a software development engineer with 8 years of experience, I would like to share my interesting perspective. 
I am planning to discuss my thoughts from a few different aspects:

- 1. [Technical debt and washing dishes](./technical-debt-and-washing-dishes.md)
- 2. Working for a big company (chain restaurants) vs. independent development (private kitchen), which one is more suitable for you?
- 3. Writing a good piece of code vs. cooking a good meal
- 4. Project architecture and meal preparation
- 5. Team collaboration and making cooking more pleasant for my fiancee


If you have experience in software development and cooking, I believe that just by reading these titles, 
you will start thinking about them involuntarily, as they are indeed intriguing.
