# How to Write Better Code and How to Cook Better Dishes

Writing code and cooking are both skills, and the growth of skills is governed by objective principles that are not influenced by subjective attitudes.

Let me start by talking about the difference between my mother and my aunt when it comes to cooking.

I've noticed for a long time that my mother is not good at cooking, and she has no intention of changing that.
The taste of her dishes has not changed for decades, and the variety of her dishes is always simple and homely.

On the other hand, my aunt is the complete opposite.
She cooks incredibly delicious meals, and the most anticipated gatherings every year are the ones held at my aunt's house.

I want to make it clear that I am not criticizing my mother. After all, she's not a chef, and she has many other things to take care of in life.

## 1. Passion and Interest

My mother has never loved cooking. It's just not something she enjoys.

When my aunt talks about cooking, she's always full of passion, with a sparkle in her eyes.

Yes, both cooking and programming are skills that require daily practice and repetition. If you don't find joy in this process, it means you don't enjoy it. It becomes more of a burden than a pleasure.

Perhaps your career path lies elsewhere. Go find something that truly excites and makes you happy.

## 2. Continuous Experimentation

My aunt loves exploring different cooking methods and how they can affect the same dish.

I often hear my aunt and cousin discussing recipes they heard or saw somewhere, and they eagerly prepare to give them a try.

They discuss the differences between the last cake they made and the current one, and what factors might have led to variations in the taste.

Is it the temperature? The ratios? Or the baking time?

Reflecting on my own career, the fastest improvement came when I constantly refactored my code, tried different approaches to achieve the same functionality, and compared the differences between them.

## 3. Learning from Exceptional People

My aunt loves watching cooking shows on TV, just like my mother does with dramas. However, what sets her apart is that she takes notes, conducts research, and tries to master the dishes introduced by the experts on those shows.

Similarly, in my career, I constantly look up, imitate, and learn from exceptional code.
