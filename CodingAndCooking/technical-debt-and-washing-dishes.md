# Technical debt and washing dishes.

When you think about it, washing dishes is the final step after a meal, and most people don't enjoy doing it. 
That is probably the main reason why dishwashers were invented.

Technical debt is similar in a way.

At the beginning of a project, there is usually no technical debt. 
However, as the project progresses, we accumulate technical debt due to various reasons such as time constraints or 
inadequate skills of team members or external factors. 

Eventually, we have to face the accumulated technical debt, 
just like we have to face a pile of dirty dishes in the sink, which can be quite overwhelming.

## Timing

Through daily observations, I have noticed that my fiancee and I have different perspectives on when to do the dishes.

I tend to clean up and wash dishes while cooking (if I have free time), just like in my professional experience, 
where I try to address some technical debt during the middle of project iterations.

On the other hand, my fiancee prefers to start washing dishes after finishing a meal, 
which can lead to a pile-up of dishes. However, she is willing to do it this way. In my work, 
I have also encountered colleagues who prefer to focus on solving current issues and then handle technical 
debt when they have time later, which ensures a faster project release.

I cannot say which approach is better. Sometimes, I choose different methods in different situations. 
For example, it's better to cook the meal earlier if I am very hungry.

## Order
When it comes to the step of washing dishes, I have realized that the order is important.

In the past, I used to clean the items in the sink from top to bottom. 

Although everything would eventually be cleaned, it would be a bit frustrating. 
Occasionally, I would discover a knife hidden underneath the bowls and plates, and that made me worried because it could accidentally cut my hand while washing.

Now, I follow a prioritized cleaning method. 

If there are items that pose a higher risk, such as knives, 
I will clean them first and put them away in the cabinet. This avoids potential problems later. If there are large pots and dishes, I clean them first to free up space in the sink, making it more comfortable and convenient for me to clean other items that require more careful washing. The lowest priority is given to regular plates and utensils, as they are easy to clean and don't take up much space.

Isn't this similar to our approach when dealing with technical debt? 

- We tackle critical areas that may cause major issues first, 
- then address relatively bigger but easier-to-solve problems, 
- and finally, handle smaller and easier-to-solve parts that have a narrower impact. 


If we focus too much on superficial problems that are right in front of us, 
we may waste too much energy and get cut by other hidden sharp edges.

## All-at-once or phased approach?
While observing my fiancee's dishwashing process, I noticed a significant difference between her approach and mine.

I prefer to wash dishes twice, just like washing hair. my fiancee likes to wash it all at once.

I throught the first wash is a rough wash to remove food residues and excess oil, 
making everything look a bit cleaner. Then, I use an adequate amount of detergent for the second wash to ensure each dish is thoroughly cleaned. I believe this approach is more satisfying and saves dishwashing liquid (as most of the excess oil has already been removed).

my fiancee's reasoning is that every time she completes washing one item, 

there is one less item in the sink, and this brings her joy. She doesn't think that my approach saves more dishwashing liquid or that it's necessary to save dishwashing liquid.
We haven't conducted an experiment to confirm whether my guess about saving dishwashing liquid is correct. It's based on my own childhood experience and teachings, and I have always believed it to be true.

It made me wonder whether I also have similar issues at work, 
where I have become accustomed to a certain way of problem-solving (performance optimization) 
and believe it to be correct, without having actual data to support it. 

I've been advancing on the path of self-improvement, achieving some optimization results that are almost imperceptible. 
Yes, I should have realized this problem earlier.


So, is an all-at-once approach better, or should we approach it in phases? 

Without data to prove it, I cannot provide an answer. I will continue to explore this question in my career.


These are some interesting thoughts I have regarding technical debt and washing dishes. I wonder what your thoughts are.
